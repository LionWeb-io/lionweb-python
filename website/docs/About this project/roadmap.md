# Status and Roadmap

The project currently support the core specifications.

It may be requiring some refining, and completing the repo client to support more rarely used APIs.

After that, we will work on implementing support for the delta protocol, as soon as it will be implemented in the LionWeb Repository.

We will then proceed to review the project, performing some general maintenance and release version 1.0.
